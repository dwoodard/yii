Summary
=======

Let's take a break and see what we have done so far:

 1. We identified the requirements to be fulfilled;
 2. We installed the Yii framework;
 3. We created a skeleton application;
 4. We designed and created the blog database;
 5. We modified the application configuration by adding the database connection;
 6. We modified the authentication method to check against the `User` table.

For a new project, most of the time will be spent in step 1 and 4 for this first milestone.
