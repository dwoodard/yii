Model-View-Controller (MVC)
===========================

Yii implements the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern which is
widely adopted in Web programming. MVC aims to separate business logic from
user interface considerations so that developers can more easily change
each part without affecting the other. In MVC, the model represents the
information (the data) and the business rules; the view contains elements
of the user interface such as text, form inputs; and the controller manages
the communication between the model and the view.

Besides MVC, Yii also introduces a front-controller, called application,
which represents the execution context of request processing. Application
resolves the user request and dispatches it to an appropriate controller
for further handling.

The following diagram shows how user requests are handling in a typical
Yii application:
