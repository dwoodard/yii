Unit Testing
============

Because the Yii testing framework is built on top of [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/), it is recommended that you go through the [PHPUnit documentation](http://www.phpunit.de/wiki/Documentation) first to get the basic understanding on how to write a unit test. We summarize in the following the basic principles of writing unit tests in Yii:

 * A unit test is saved in a PHP file named as `XyzTest.php`, where `Xyz` stands for the class being tested. By convention, these unit test files may be stored under the directory `protected/tests/unit`.

 * The test file should contain a class named `XyzTest` which extends [CTestCase] or [CDbTestCase]. The former is meant for generic unit tests, while the latter is suitable for testing [active record](/doc/guide/database.ar) model classes.

 * The test class mainly contains a set of test methods named as `testAbc`, wherer `Abc` is often the name of the class method to be tested.

 * A test method usually contains a sequence of assertion statements (e.g. `assertTrue`, `assertEquals`) which serve as checkpoints on validating the behavior of the target class.


In the following, we mainly describe how to write unit tests for [active record](/doc/guide/database.ar) model classes. We will extend our test classes from [CDbTestCase] because it provides the database fixture support from Yii that we introduced in the previous section.
