Working with Database
=====================

Yii provides powerful support for database programming. Built on top of
the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension, Yii Data Access Objects (DAO) enables
accessing to different database management systems (DBMS) in a single
uniform interface. Applications developed using Yii DAO can be easily
switched to use a different DBMS without the need to modify the data
accessing code. Yii Active Record (AR), implemented as a widely adopted
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) approach, further simplifies database
programming. Representing a table in terms of a class and a row an
instance, Yii AR eliminates the repetitive task of writing those SQL
statements that mainly deal with CRUD (create, read, update and delete)
operations.

Although Yii DAO and AR can handle nearly all database-related tasks, you
can still use your own database libraries in your Yii application. As a
matter of fact, Yii framework is carefully designed to be used together
with other third-party libraries.
