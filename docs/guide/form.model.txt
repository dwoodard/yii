Creating Model
==============

Before writing the HTML code needed by a form, we should decide what kind
of data we are expecting from end users and what rules these data should
comply with. A model class can be used to record these information. A
model, as defined in the [Model](/doc/guide/basics.model) subsection, is
the central place for keeping user inputs and validating them.

Depending on how we make use of the user input, we can create two types of
model. If the user input is collected, used and then discarded, we would
create a [form model](/doc/guide/basics.model); if the user input is
collected and saved into database, we would use an [active
record](/doc/guide/database.ar) instead. Both types of model share the same
base class [CModel] which defines the common interface needed by form.

> Note: We are mainly using form models in the examples of this section.
However, the same can also be applied to [active
record](/doc/guide/database.ar) models.

Defining Model Class
--------------------

Below we create a `LoginForm` model class used to collect user input on a
login page. Because the login information is only used to authenticate the
user and does not need to be saved, we create `LoginForm` as a form model.

~~~
[php]
class LoginForm extends CFormModel
{
	public $username;
	public $password;
	public $rememberMe=false;
}
~~~

Three attributes are declared in `LoginForm`: `$username`, `$password` and
`$rememberMe`. They are used to keep the user-entered username and
password, and the option whether the user wants to remember his login.
Because `$rememberMe` has a default value `false`, the corresponding option
when initially displayed in the login form will be unchecked.

> Info: Instead of calling these member variables properties, we use the
name *attributes* to differentiate them from normal properties. An
attribute is a property that is mainly used to store data coming from user
input or database.

Declaring Validation Rules
--------------------------

Once a user submits his inputs and the model gets populated, we need to
make sure the inputs are valid before using them. This is done by
performing validation of the inputs against a set of rules. We specify the
validation rules in the `rules()` method which should return an array of
rule configurations.

~~~
[php]
class LoginForm extends CFormModel
{
	public $username;
	public $password;
	public $rememberMe=false;

	public function rules()
	{
		return array(
			array('username, password', 'required'),
			array('password', 'authenticate'),
		);
	}

	public function authenticate($attribute,$params)
	{
		if(!$this->hasErrors())  // we only want to authenticate when no input errors
		{
			$identity=new UserIdentity($this->username,$this->password);
			if($identity->authenticate())
			{
				$duration=$this->rememberMe ? 3600*24*30 : 0; // 30 days
				Yii::app()->user->login($identity,$duration);
			}
			else
				$this->addError('password','Incorrect password.');
		}
	}
}
~~~

The above code specifies that `username` and `password` are both required,
and `password` should be authenticated.

Each rule returned by `rules()` must be of the following format:

~~~
[php]
array('AttributeList', 'Validator', ...additional options)
~~~

where `AttributeList` is a string of comma-separated attribute names which
need to be validated with the rule; `Validator` specifies what kind of
validation should be performed; and additional options are used to
configure the validation.

There are three ways to specify `Validator` in a validation rule. First,
`Validator` can be the name of a method in the model class, like
`authenticate` in the above example. The validator method must be of the
following signature:

~~~
[php]
/**
 * @param string the name of the attribute to be validated
 * @param array options specified in the validation rule
 */
public function ValidatorName($attribute,$params) { ... }
~~~

Second, `Validator` can be the name of a validator class. When the rule is
applied, an instance of the validator class will be created to perform the
actual validation. The additional options in the rule are used to
initialize the instance's attribute values. A validator class must extend
from [CValidator].

> Note: When specifying rules for an active record model, we can use a
special option named `on`. The option can be either `'insert'` or
`'update'` so that the rule is applied only when inserting or updating the
record, respectively. If not set, the rule would be applied in both cases
when `save()` is called.

Third, `Validator` can be a predefined alias to a validator class. In the
above example, the name `required` is the alias to [CRequiredValidator]
which ensures the attribute value being validated is not empty. Below is
the complete list of predefined validator aliases:

   - `captcha`: alias of [CCaptchaValidator], ensuring the attribute is
equal to the verification code displayed in a
[CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha).

   - `compare`: alias of [CCompareValidator], ensuring the attribute is
equal to another attribute or constant.
   
   - `email`: alias of [CEmailValidator], ensuring the attribute is a
valid email address.
   
   - `filter`: alias of [CFilterValidator], transforming the attribute
with a filter.
   
   - `in`: alias of [CRangeValidator], ensuring the data is among a
pre-specified list of values.
   
   - `length`: alias of [CStringValidator], ensuring the length of the
data is within certain range.
   
   - `match`: alias of [CRegularExpressionValidator], ensuring the data
matches a regular expression.
   
   - `numerical`: alias of [CNumberValidator], ensuring the data is a
valid number.
   
   - `required`: alias of [CRequiredValidator], ensuring the attribute is
not empty.
   
   - `type`: alias of [CTypeValidator], ensuring the attribute is of
specific data type.
   
   - `unique`: alias of [CUniqueValidator], ensuring the data is unique in
a database table column.
   
   - `url`: alias of [CUrlValidator], ensuring the data is a valid URL.

Below we list some examples of using the predefined validators:

~~~
[php]
// ensure password attribute is the same as password2 attribute
array('password', 'compare', 'compareAttribute'=>'password2')
// ensure username's length is between 3 and 12
array('username', 'length', 'min'=>3, 'max'=>12)
// ensure age is a non-negative integer
array('age', 'numeric', 'integerOnly'=>true, 'min'=>0)
~~~

Triggering Validation
---------------------

To trigger validation, we can call [CModel::validate()]. The method
returns a value indicating whether the validation is successful without any
error. For active record model, when we call [save()|CActiveRecord::save]
to save the model to database, validation will be automatically performed.

Retrieving Validation Errors
----------------------------

We can use [CModel::hasErrors()] to check if there is any validation
error, and if yes, we can use [CModel::getErrors()] to obtain the error
messages. Both methods can be used for all attributes or an individual
attribute.

Attribute Labels
----------------

When designing a form, we often need to display a label for each input
field. The label tells a user what kind of information he is expected to
enter into the field. Although we can hardcode a label in a view, it would
offer more flexibility and convenience if we specify it in the
corresponding model.

By default, [CModel] will simply return the name of an attribute as its
label. This can be customized by overriding the
[attributeLabels()|CModel::attributeLabels] method. As we will see in the
following subsections, specifying labels in the model allows us to create a
form more quickly and powerful.
