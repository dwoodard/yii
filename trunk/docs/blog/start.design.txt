Overall Design
==============

Based on the analysis of the requirements, we identify that our blog application requires four database tables to store data: `User`, `Post`, `Comment` and `Tag`:

 * `User` stores the user information, including username and password.
 * `Post` stores post information. It mainly consists of the following columns:
	 - `title`: required, title of the post;
	 - `content`: required, body content of the post which uses the [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax);
	 - `status`: required, status of the post, which can be one of following values:
		 * `draft`: the post is in draft and is not visible to public;
		 * `published`: the post is published to public;
		 * `archived`: the post is outdated and is not visible to public.
	 - `tags`: optional, a list of comma-separated words categorizing the post.
 * `Comment` stores post comment information. Each comment is associated with a post and mainly consists of the following columns:
	 - `name`: required, the author name;
	 - `email`: required, the author email;
	 - `website`: optional, the author website URL;
	 - `content`: required, the comment content which uses the [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
	 - `status`: required, status of the comment, which indicates whether the comment is approved (value 1) or not (value 0).
 * `Tag` stores post tag information. Each post can have multiple tags, while each tag can also be attached to multiple posts. The `Tag` table is mainly used by the tag cloud portlet which needs to calculate the use frequency of each tag.

The following entity-relation (ER) diagram shows the table structure and relationships about the above tables. Note that the relationship between `Post` and `Tag` is many-to-many, we use the `PostTag` table to decouple this relationship into two one-to-many relationships.

Complete SQL statements corresponding to the above ER diagram may be found in [the blog demo](http://www.yiiframework.com/demos/blog/). In our Yii installation, they are in the file `/wwwroot/yii/demos/blog/protected/data/schema.sqlite.sql`.


We divide the development of our blog application into the following milestones.

 * Milestone 1: creating a prototype of the blog system. It should consist of most of the required functionalities.
 * Milestone 2: completing post management. It includes creating, listing, showing, updating and deleting posts.
 * Milestone 3: completing comment management. It includes creating, listing, approving, updating and deleting post comments.
 * Milestone 4: implementing portlets. It includes user menu, login, tag cloud and recent comments portlets.
 * Milestone 5: final tune-up and deployment.
