Beautifying URLs
================

The URLs linking various pages of our blog application currently look ugly. For example, the URL for the page showing a post looks like the following:

~~~
/index.php?r=post/show&id=1
~~~

In this section, we describe how to beautifying these URLs and make them SEO-friendly. Our goal is to be able to use the following URLs in the application:

 * `/index.php/tag/yii`: leads to the page showing a list of posts with tag `yii`;
 * `/index.php/posts`: leads to the page showing the latest posts;
 * `/index.php/post/1`: leads to the page showing the detail of the post with ID 1;
 * `/index.php/post/update/1`: leads to the page that allows updating the post with ID 1.

To achieve our goal, we modify the [application configuration](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.application#application-configuration) as follows,

~~~
[php]
return array(
	......
	'components'=>array(
		......
		'urlManager'=>array(
			'urlFormat'=>'path',
			'rules'=>array(
				'tag/<tag>'=>'post/list',
				'posts'=>'post/list',
				'post/<id:\d+>'=>'post/show',
				'post/update/<id:\d+>'=>'post/update',
			),
		),
	),
);
~~~

In the above, we configure the [urlManager](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/topics.url) component by setting its `urlFormat` property to be `path` and adding a set of `rules`.

The rules are used by `urlManager` to parse and create the URLs in the desired format. For example, the first rule says that if a URL `/index.php/tag/yii` is requested, the `urlManager` component should be responsible to dispatch the request to the [route](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.controller#route) `post/list` and generate a `tag` GET parameter with the value `yii`. On the other hand, when creating a URL with the route `post/list` and parameter `tag`, the `urlManager` component will also use this rule to generate the desired URL `/index.php/tag/yii`. For this reason, we say that `urlManager` is a two-way URL manager.

The `urlManager` component can further beautify our URLs, such as hiding `index.php` in the URLs, appending suffix like `.html` to the URLs. We can obtain these features easily by configuring various properties of `urlManager` in the application configuration.
