directory. You shall see the following files and directories:

      demos/               demos

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports
PHP 5.1.0 or above. Yii has been tested with Apache HTTP server
on Windows and Linux operating systems.

Please access the following URL to check if your Web server reaches
the requirements by Yii, assuming "YiiPath" is where Yii is installed:

      http://hostname/YiiPath/requirements/index.php


QUICK START
-----------
Yii comes with a skeleton application located under the directory
"testdrive". It is a good starting point for your application.
You can access it with the following URL:

        http://hostname/YiiPath/testdrive/index.php
